# Carrie Programming Language
(Old version description):
This is not an enjoyable language to write in. Take the most ugly weird Pascal code and then put it all into one String 
with made of a different pairs of functions and arguments. Completely unreadable. Not anywhere near done. Named after 
the Sufjan Stevens album "Carrie and Lowell".

(New version description):
Carrie is a small programming language written in Haskell using the Parsec library. VERY INCOMPLETE AND NON FUNCTIONAL.

## Built With

* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) - Compiler code
* [Parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec) - Only dependancy
* [Carrie and Lowell] When you need a good cry

## Inspired/Built With Help From

*[WhileParser](https://wiki.haskell.org/Parsing_a_simple_imperative_language) - While Parser from the Haskell Wiki (Some code was ripped from this tutorial)
