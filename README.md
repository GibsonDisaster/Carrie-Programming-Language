# Carrie Programming Language
Carrie is a small programming language written in Haskell using the Parsec library, named after the Sufjan Stevens album "Carrie and Lowell". VERY INCOMPLETE AND NON FUNCTIONAL. Currently it is more of a parser than a compiler (but not really a parser yet either).

## Built With

* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) - Compiler code
* [Parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec) - Only dependancy
* [Carrie and Lowell] When you need a good cry
