# Carrie Programming Language

A general purpose programming language. Not anywhere near done. Named after the Sufjan Stevens album "Carrie and Lowell".

## Getting Started

Compiler is not working yet.

## How It Works

Compiler is written in Haskell using only standard libraries and functions written by myself. No external libraries required
to use this compiler.

## Planned Features

Functions, Classes, data types, loops, etc. Carrie will be a mostly Imperative programming language, with Functional
influences.

## Built With

* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) - Compiler code
* [Carrie and Lowell] When you need a good cry
